# Wildfire_Detection_Image_Segmentation
This project explores the application of deep learning-based semantic segmentation to improve wildfire detection accuracy and real-time monitoring.
Overview of Approach:
This project explores the application of deep learningbased semantic segmentation to improve wildfire detection
accuracy and real-time monitoring. We aim to develop a
model that can process aerial and satellite imagery to detect
and delineate fire-affected regions. Our approach involves:
• Data Preprocessing: Annotating wildfire images, applying data augmentation techniques, if necessary.
• Model Selection: Evaluating convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture like U-Net and
transformer-based architectures such as Segformer,
leveraging backbone networks like ResNet and EfficientNet.
• Training and Loss Optimization: Using Dice Loss or
Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy Loss to address class
imbalance between the background pixels and the fire
pixels.
• Evaluation Metrics: Some common metrics for semantic segmentation that we chose to use include IoU,
Precision, Recall, F1 Score, False Positive & False
Negative Rates, Pixel Accuracy, and Inference Speed.
